What could be better than an exclusive NFTs for MLH graduates in AR!  
MLH Grads is a decentralised application (dApp) that makes it simple to create your MLH Graduation NFT on the Solana Blockchain. It supports two wallets, each of which offers a simple way to complete a transaction. You can easily sell and buy MLH fellows NFTs on this platform. We verify the NFT by GitHub username as the username should belong to the MLH fellowship organisation!


<br></br>
<br></br>

## What it does :
- Users may log in to the app by connecting their wallet. 
- Only MLH fellows will be allowed to create a NFT with up to 30 characters of name, 30 characters of pod name, and 39 characters of Github username. 
- Anyone can buy the NFTs at listed price. 
- NFTs can also be viewed in AR.
